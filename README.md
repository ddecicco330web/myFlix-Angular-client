# MyFlixAngularClient

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.9.
This app lets you view movie info and create a list of your favorite movies. The purpose of this project was to learn how to use Angular, Angular Material, and Typescript. I learned a lot about the differences between React and Angular.
